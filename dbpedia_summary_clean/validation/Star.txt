There is a magnitude 12.5 optical companion, located at an angular separation of 12.7 arcseconds and a position angle of 118° as of the year 1943.
It is the brightest X-ray source in the cluster, and was discovered in 2005 in observations made by the Chandra X-ray observatory.
This is a B-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of B9.5V.
It is located in the constellation of Centaurus, approximately 320 light years distant from the solar system.
RS Puppis is a Cepheid variable star in the constellation of Puppis.
Its radius is constrained to be less than 16 km.
For other star systems with this Bayer designation, see Omega Aquarii.
Alpha Leporis has a stellar classification of F0 Ib, with the Ib luminosity class indicating that it is a lower luminosity supergiant star.
The combined apparent visual magnitude is 5.27, making it faintly visible to the naked eye.
It is located relatively near the Sun at an distance of 23 light-years.
This star was first catalogued by American astronomer Frank Elmore Ross in 1925, and formed part of his fourth list of new variable stars.
Its most unusual aspect is the production of anomalous cosmic ray events in a proton decay detector deep in Minnesota's Soudan iron mine.
The star is 100K hotter, 1.8 Gya older, and 1.5 times more enrich in heavy elements [Fe/H] than our Sun.
The primary is a B-type star with a stellar classification of B1.5 V or B2 IV, depending on the source.
It is 5.4 times more massive than the Sun, and has a luminosity of almost 800 L☉.
At the estimated distance of Delta Ophiuchi, this yields a physical size of about 67 times the radius of the Sun.
In 2009, a gas giant planet was found in orbit around the star.
Viewing it requires a telescope with an aperture of 15 cm or more.
It is dimly visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 5.75.
Because of Proxima Centauri's proximity to Earth, its angular diameter can be measured directly.
HD 190228 is a star located in the constellation Vulpecula.
Located around 176 light-years distant, it shines with a luminosity approximately 9 times that of the Sun and has a surface temperature of 5011 K.
Consequently, δ Andromedae itself is known as 奎宿五
This illustrates the potential dangers of attempting to detect planets by white dwarf pulsation timing.
The 1913 event was the brightest of the observed outbursts, reaching a photographic magnitude of 7.0.
It is an α² CVn variable, ranging from 4.51 to 4.44 magnitude with a period of 2.99 days.
A class K2-3III orange giant, its apparent magnitude is 5.04 and it is approximately 362 light years away based on parallax.
The primary star is a class K0III star.
Tau Ceti is a star in the constellation Cetus that is spectrally similar to the Sun, although it has only about 78% of the Sun's mass.
GD 40 is a white dwarf in the constellation Cetus.
The apparent visual magnitude of this star is +2.8, making it the third-brightest member of Virgo.
Parallax measurements made with the Hipparcos spacecraft yield an estimated distance of around 141 light years from the Sun.
They are capable of keeping time as well as atomic clocks.
There is an ultraviolet excess from V424 Lacertae, that may be due to an unseen companion, which could also explain the long secondary period.
Xi Tauri is a hierarchical quadruple system in the constellation Taurus.
This is an evolved, G-type giant star with a stellar classification of G8 III.
This star can be readily located as it lies to the south and west of the prominent star Achernar in the constellation Eridanus.
Zeta Arietis is the Bayer designation for a star in the northern constellation of Aries.
As a binary star system, they would have an estimated orbital period of at least 19,500 years and a present-day separation of around 2,000 Astronomical Units.
Specifically, the star is representative of O9V stars, meaning relatively cool O-type stars on the main-sequence.
24 Aquarii is a double star in the equatorial constellation of Aquarius.
