Reckahn III, completed in 2011, added 1.8 MW, bringing the total to 37.7 MW.
Construction of the second reactor started in 1983 with plans to finish it in 1991.
The power plant is owned and operated by the Naturkraft company, which is itself equally owned by Statkraft and Statoil.
Finally is the Tevaiohiro Dam at 85 m above sea level with a reservoir volume of 150,000 m3.
The project utilizes nearly 2 million thin-film photovoltaic modules made of CdTe, designed and manufactured by First Solar and covers an area of 946 acres.
It had a proposed capacity of up to 630MW, at the time making it the largest wind farm project in the southern hemisphere.
Concrete pouring began in 2006 and the power plant began producing electricity in November 2010.
The Project is entirely financed from domestic financial institutions and companies.
It straddles the border between Bedford and Coffee counties.
It is on the seasonal Damsal River and primarily serves for flood control and irrigation in the area.
The operating company Nuklearna elektrarna Krško is co-owned by the Slovenian state-owned company Gen-Energija and the Croatian state-owned company Hrvatska elektroprivreda.
Reactor one was designed with a 460 MWe rating, and reactor two with a 808 MWe rating.
The project is expected to be complete in June 2016.
The groundbreaking ceremony occurred on February 19, 1937, with United States Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes attending.
The estimated cost of the project is US$4.2 billion.
It has a huge coal-fired thermal power plant and a gas-fired plant and has a small township located in Uttar Pradesh, India for its employees.
Miyashita Dam is a gravity dam on the Tadami River 2 km upstream of Mishima in the Fukushima Prefecture of Japan.
Additional dam structures were completed downstream in the 1970s.
The dam's primary functions are flood control, power generation, irrigation, fish habitat, water quality improvement, and recreation.
The Gardiner Dam was constructed between 1959 and 1967.
The dam is located north of Newcastle and within the Port Stephens Council local government area in the Lower Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia.
