Ximenes Redoubt is a redoubt in Salina Bay, Naxxar, Malta.
The fort has been continually occupied since 1748, and is the core from which the city of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec grew around.
Rapid improvements to artillery technology in the mid-19th century meant that the tower was effectively obsolete as soon as it had been completed.
Built in stone, it was never modernized to deal with explosive projectiles.
It is located 5.8 miles southwest of the Santa Rosa Island dock, California.
Active flying stopped on 15 August 1945, and the site was closed on 1 February 1947.
The station was described as starting to operate at the end of 2006  and then entering "experimental combat mode" in 2008.
The basement and first floor hall of this tower are vaulted and in one corner is a turnpike stair that leads to the upper floors.
